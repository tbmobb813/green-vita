## Install

You need a homebrew-enabled PS Vita with VitaShell and an Xbox account that has
access to Xbox Cloud Gaming.

1. Download `green-vita.vpk` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Day-OS/green-vita/releases/latest).
2. Transfer the VPK to the Vita.
3. Install it with VitaShell.
4. Launch GreenVita and complete the device-code sign-in.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enable **Unsafe Homebrew** in HENkaku Settings. GreenVita needs access to the
> Vita hardware video-decoder module.

## Build

### 1. Install VitaSDK

GreenVita follows the official [VitaSDK/VDPM setup](https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm).
On Arch Linux, install the host tools first:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git cmake python wget patch p7zip tar pkgconf rustup
```

Then bootstrap VitaSDK and its port libraries:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm
cd vdpm
./bootstrap-vitasdk.sh

export VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk
export PATH="$VITASDK/bin:$PATH"

./install-all.sh
```

`install-all.sh` installs the Vita port libraries used by this project,
including SDL2 and Opus. The old vitaGL/vitaShaRK dependency list is not needed.

Add these exports to your shell profile so future terminals can find VitaSDK:

```sh
export VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk
export PATH="$VITASDK/bin:$PATH"
```

> [!TIP]
> On Windows, VitaSDK recommends following the Linux instructions through
> WSL2. MSYS2 is also supported by VDPM, but WSL2 is the simpler route.

### 2. Install the Rust tools

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo +nightly install cargo-vita
```

See the official [`cargo-vita` documentation](https://github.com/vita-rust/cargo-vita)
for its complete command reference.

`cargo-vita` itself just needs some nightly to install with. Building GreenVita
is separate and pins its own exact nightly via
[`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) - rustup installs that specific
toolchain automatically the first time you build, no manual toolchain
selection needed for that step.

### 3. Build the VPK

From the GreenVita repository:

```sh
make vpk
```

The Makefile supplies the required Vita Rust flags. The resulting package is:

```text
target/armv7-sony-vita-newlibeabihf/release/green-vita.vpk
```

<details>
<summary>Building without Make</summary>

Unix-like shell:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-neon" cargo vita build vpk --release
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:RUSTFLAGS = "-C target-feature=-neon"
cargo vita build vpk --release
```

The repository contains platform wrappers under [`tools/`](tools/) so Cargo can
find the Vita compiler, archiver, and pkg-config implementation on Unix and Windows.

</details>

## Develop On Hardware

For the commands below, install
[`vitacompanion`](https://github.com/devnoname120/vitacompanion) on the Vita and
leave its FTP server running.

### First installation

```sh
make upload-vpk VITA_IP=192.168.0.103
```

This uploads the package to `ux0:/data/green-vita.vpk`; it does not install it.
Open VitaShell and install that file once. To choose another upload directory:

```sh
make upload-vpk VITA_IP=192.168.0.103 VITA_UPLOAD_DIR=ux0:/downloads/
```

### Fast update and run

After the VPK is installed:

```sh
make update-run-vita VITA_IP=192.168.0.103
```

This rebuilds `eboot.bin`, replaces `ux0:/app/GREENVITA/eboot.bin`, and starts
the application. `make run-vita VITA_IP=...` is an alias for the same command.

> [!CAUTION]
> The update command replaces only `eboot.bin`. Reinstall the complete VPK
> whenever package metadata or files under `static/` change.

<details>
<summary>FTP error 550: File not found</summary>

The destination directory must already exist. Install the VPK before using
`update-run-vita`, and make sure the upload directory passed through
`VITA_UPLOAD_DIR` exists on the Vita memory card.
